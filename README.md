# Enhancing Mobile Application Security: An Integrated Framework with Link Security Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the research paper "Enhancing Mobile Application Security: An Integrated Framework with Link Security Assessment." The project introduces a novel framework that combines traditional mobile application security testing methodologies with a dedicated **Link Security Tester** module. The framework aims to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in mobile applications, focusing on both internal application logic and the security of external links embedded within the apps.

The framework integrates:

*   **Static Analysis:** Examines application code for vulnerabilities without execution.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Monitors application behavior during runtime to detect vulnerabilities.
*   **Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection:** Uses an LSTM model to identify unusual patterns that may indicate security risks.
*   **Link Security Tester:** A novel module that assesses the security of external links using a multi-faceted approach (SSL/TLS checks, DNS resolution, WHOIS information, HTTP requests).

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Security Evaluation:** Combines multiple testing techniques for a holistic assessment.
*   **Novel Link Security Tester:** Addresses the often-overlooked risk of malicious external links.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Leverages an LSTM model for anomaly detection.
*   **Detailed Reporting:** Generates comprehensive reports, including vulnerability details, threat classifications, and link security assessments.
*   **Extensible Design:** The framework can be extended with new analysis modules and security checks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-app-security-framework.git
    cd mobile-app-security-framework
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    **Note:** The code requires additional dependencies for full functionality:
    ```bash
    pip install requests dnspython python-whois certifi
    ```

3. **Install TensorFlow:**
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow
    ```

## Usage

1. **Configuration:**

    *   Modify the `config.json` file to set parameters for the different modules (e.g., paths to analysis tools, API keys, etc.).
    *   Example `config.json`:

```json
{
    "static_analysis": {
        "enabled": true,
        "tool_path": "/path/to/static/analyzer"
    },
    "dynamic_analysis": {
        "enabled": true,
        "emulator_path": "/path/to/android/emulator"
    },
    "machine_learning": {
        "enabled": true,
        "model_path": "machine_learning/model.h5"
    },
    "link_security_tester": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

2. **Running the Framework:**

    *   Place the mobile applications (APKs) you want to test in the `data/` directory.
    *   Execute the `main.py` script:

    ```bash
    python main.py --app data/app1.apk data/app2.apk
    ```
    Or, to test specific links:
    ```bash
    python main.py --links https://www.example.com https://github.com http://suspicious-site.com
    ```

3. **Viewing Results:**

    *   The framework will generate reports in the `data/results/` directory.
    *   Reports will include:
        *   Static analysis findings
        *   Dynamic analysis findings
        *   Anomaly detection results
        *   Link security assessments (including security scores and identified risks)
    *   Example Link Security Report Output:
    ```text
    Link Security Report:

## Dataset

The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 1,000 mobile applications from various categories. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size and potential privacy concerns. However, a sample of training data for the machine learning model is provided in `machine_learning/training_data.csv`.
